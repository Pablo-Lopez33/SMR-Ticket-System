# Small Engine Repair Ticket System

This program allows a small engine repair shop to keep track of units in for repair accurately.

Each ticket requires the following information: First name/Last name, phone number, unit model, serial number, and ticket number. 

This program allows units to be checked in, marked as "In Progress", "Waiting for parts", "Closed", "Not Repairable"

It will have a lookup function to check the status of tickets/units.
